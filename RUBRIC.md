- **API Architecture**
    - Meets Specification: App is architected as a Web Service API.
    - Meets Specification: App supports a variety of possible front-end clients.

- **API Implementation**
    - Meets Specification: A new type of game is implemented with additional game logic or features (such as 2-player games).
      The new game is not a copy of Guess a Number.
      If it is a guessing game like Hangman, additional features are included (partial reveal of the solution over time).
    - Meets Specification: "Illegal" moves are handled gracefully by the API.
      For example, if implementing Tic-Tac-Toe, if a User tries to play a square that has already been filled - the server will respond with an error message explaining that the move is illegal.
      There should be no 'Internal Server Errors' so long as User input is otherwise properly formed.
    
- **Documentation**
    - Meets Specification: A README file is included with steps necessary to run the application locally.
    - Meets Specification: The new game is documented in a README.md file, with explanation of the rules and score-keeping.
    - Meets Specification: The API is documented so that users can understand how to use the API without reading the source code.
    - Meets Specificaiton: The student has meaningfully reflected on their design decisions and recorded their reflections in Design.txt.
    
- **New Endpoints Created**
    - Meets Specification: required endpoints are implemented with behavior that follows the project description.
    - Meets Specification: `get_game_history` is created. The output should be sufficient to 'replay' the game from start to finish and get the same result (notwithstanding any randomization inherent to the game). <todo is this redundant? does the previoius item cover this?)
    
- **Appropriate use of HTTP Methods**
    - Meets Specification: Additional endpoints make use of appropriate HTTP methods.

- **Resource Containers**
    - Meets Specification: All endpoints make use of sensible Resource Containers.

- **Code Readability**
    - Meets Specification: Code formatting follows consistent rules for variable, function, class etc. naming conventions. Line length is not excessive and white-space is used appropriately to improve readability.
    - Meets Specification: Functions and methods include descriptive docstrings, and code that is not immediately understandable includes comments.
     
- **Task Queues**
    - Meets Specification: The email reminder cronjob handler is modified so that only Users 'needing' a reminder (actual logic up to the student) is modified.
